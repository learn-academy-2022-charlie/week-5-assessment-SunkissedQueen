# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

  Your answer: Answers provided by cohort

  Researched answer: Ruby Hashes are a dictionary-like set of keys and values. Since hashes are associative arrays, they use any data type instead of numbers as an index. They keys in a hash are symbols. Hashes are considered enumerable because Ruby uses duck type. Duck type is when something is similar to another thing, the same methods should work on both. Since hashes are like lists, methods that work on lists like map, and forEach would work.



2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: Answers provided by cohort

  Researched answer:  A gem is a Ruby library or framework. It allows for added functionality or automates processes for the developer. A gem I was recently introduced to was Ruby on Rails. It’s a gem that uses a ton of other specialized gems to quickly create web apps. Without gems a developer could spend hours to get the same functionality as what a gem can do in minutes.
  Another great gem I’ve been using is RSpec. It a testing framework that supports behavior driven development. It can be tedious writing a test that is three times as long as the code it’s testing, but it’s good to check that everything is working well together.



3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Answers provided by cohort

  Researched answer: The framework of Ruby on Rails simplifies the creation of the backend portions of programming by providing a default database and structure the you can use as a foundation. ROR uses a Model-View-Controller architectural pattern which has three main parts. First, the Model is the "memory card" of our application which holds the data and logic. Next, the Controller is the brain, making the decision and handles the requests and responses between the server and user. View is what the user sees and interacts with handing the data to the controller to decide what to do with the users requests.



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: Answers provided by cohort

  Researched answer: A relational database is a database that is structured similar to an Excel spreadsheet or Google Sheet where the document of information is displayed on a table with columns, rows, and headers. With this, an important feature of relational databases is that tables can have RELATIONSHIPS with other tables that link tables together and organize data more efficiently. There is another type of popular database that is recognized that that uses a document database model. MongoDB and DynamoDB are two of the most popular document databases. From experience, I have worked with both. I used a relational database for basic user information to reference to. I also used DynamoDB / MongoDB for a social media project that I previously built. I know that one is not better than the other and that they both have their own use cases and benefits.



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Answers provided by cohort

  Researched answer:  I learned there are more then just an alternate key. BUt those other keys are known as alternate. they can consist of a natural key which is based on real word type of things while there are keys that fall out of a data base which is called a surrogate. A primary key though, is what can identify someone above all else. so this is giving everything it's unique identifier. This is important because there can be a case where some attributes may be the same in some areas, but will give you what you truly want will be the primary key. You can have two rows with the exact same everything, but the thing that will define what you are truly looking for will be the primary key. Like a Gamer-tag, if you already have the name, no one else can use it, but they can have the same everything else.
